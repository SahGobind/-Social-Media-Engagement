📊 Social Media Engagement Dashboard - Power BI Project

🔍 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides insights into social media engagement patterns across various platforms, brands, topics, emotions, and days of the week. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and modified for better analysis. The dashboard helps in identifying which platforms and brands have the highest engagement, the sentiment of users, and the toxicity levels in interactions.

📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Social Media Engagement Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- The dataset was cleaned and modified using **Microsoft Excel** before being imported into Power BI.
- Sample columns:
  - `Day of Week`, `Platform`, `Location`, `Language`, `Hashtags`
  - `Topic Category`, `Sentiment Label`, `Emotion Type`, `Toxity Score`
  - `Likes Count`, `Shares Count`, `Comments Count`, `Engagement Rate`
  - `Brand Name`, `Campaign Name`, `Campaign Phase`

🛠️ Measures Created (DAX)

```DAX
Total Engagement Rate = SUM([Engagement Rate])
AVG Engagement Rate = AVERAGE([Engagement Rate])
No of Locations = COUNTROWS('Social Media Engagement')
AVG Toxity Score = AVERAGE([Toxity Score])
````

**A dynamic parameter table was created to switch between these four KPIs:**

```DAX
Parameter = {
    ("Avg Engagement Rate", NAMEOF('Social Media Engagement'[Avg Engagement Rate]), 0),
    ("Avg Toxity Score", NAMEOF('Social Media Engagement'[Avg Toxity Score]), 1),
    ("No of Locations", NAMEOF('Social Media Engagement'[No of Locations]), 2),
    ("Total Engagement Rate", NAMEOF('Social Media Engagement'[Total Engagement Rate]), 3)
}
```
